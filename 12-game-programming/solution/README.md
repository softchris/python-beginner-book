# Solution

This folder consist of several solution files.

- `solution.py` - This is the main solution file for the game. It needs you to install `pygame` library. You can install it using the command `pip install pygame` or use `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Or you could first create a virtual environment and then install it like so:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- `refactored.py` - This is the refactored version of the game. It is a more organized and modular version of the game code. It uses classes to encapsulate the game logic and makes it easier to understand and maintain. Same instructions there for installing `pygame` apply here as well.
