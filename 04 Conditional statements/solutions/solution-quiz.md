**Question**. In a Python conditional statement, what will happen if the condition in the if statement is False and no else or elif statement follows it?

1. An error will occur

2. The program will stop

3. Nothing will happen and the program will continue

4. The condition will be checked again

**A**: **3.** Nothing will happen and the program will continue. In Python, if the condition in the if statement is False, and no else or elif statements are present, the program simply continues to the next line of code after the if statement.

**Question**. How many elif statements can you have in a Python conditional block?

1. Only one

2. Only two

3. As many as you want

4. None

**A**: **3.** As many as you want. Python allows you to include as many elif statements as necessary within a conditional block. Each elif statement is evaluated in order, and only the block of code under the first elif statement that evaluates to True gets executed.

**Question**:. Consider the following Python code snippet:

```python
x = 10
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x < 10:
    print("x is less than 10")
else:
    print("x is equal to 10")
```

What will be the output?

1. x is greater than 10

2. x is equal to 10 

3. x is less than 10

4. The code will give an error

**A**: **b** x is equal to 10. The value of x is equal to 10, so neither the if nor the elif condition is true. Therefore, the else block of code gets executed, which prints "x is equal to 10".
